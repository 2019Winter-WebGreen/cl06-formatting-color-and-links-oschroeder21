            <p>A Shihtzu is a very small dog! They are hypoallergenic (they have hair instead of fur!) meaning they do not shed and no ones allergic!</p>
            <p>Most of the time these cute things are dog friendly, and people friendly. They need a lot of love and time because they have health issues, and a lot of grooming needs for thier fabulous hair.</p>
            <p>Show dogs that are Shih Tzu's usually grow out their locks, but most people shave it down because the hair is a lot to take care of!</p>
            <p>Though, overall these dogs have a lot to offer and will give you a all the love!</p>
